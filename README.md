# motivating-feature-scaling
This is learning material that explains why and when feature scaling is necessary in Machine Learning.

## Introduction
Machine Learning algorithms often times need scaled data. This document aims to provide some base-level intuition for why that is. It also discusses an examplary algorithm with Gradient descent and tries to exemplify the problem.

## Concepts explained
1. Euclidean distance
2. Gradient descent algorithm
