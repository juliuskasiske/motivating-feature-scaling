# motivating-feature-scaling
This is learning material that explains why and when feature scaling is necessary in Machine Learning.

## 1. Introduction
Machine Learning algorithms often times need scaled data. This document aims to provide some base-level intuition for why that is. It also discusses an examplary algorithm with Gradient descent and tries to exemplify the problem.

## 2. Concepts explained
- Euclidean distance
- Gradient descent algorithm
